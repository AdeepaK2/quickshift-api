}
```

## Business Rules

### Rating Creation Rules
1. **Gig Must Be Completed** - Can only rate workers for completed or verified gigs
2. **Payment Required** - Worker must be paid before rating can be created
3. **No Duplicates** - One rating per employer per worker per gig completion
4. **Employer Authorization** - Only the employer who hired the worker can rate them

### Rating Update Rules
1. **Owner Only** - Only the employer who created the rating can update it
2. **Time Limit** - Ratings can only be updated within 30 days of creation
3. **Partial Updates** - Any combination of fields can be updated

### Rating Calculation
- **Overall Rating** = Average of all detailed ratings (punctuality, quality, professionalism, communication, reliability)
- **User Average Rating** = Average of all active ratings for the user
- **Recommendation Rate** = Percentage of ratings where wouldRecommend is true

## Integration with User Profile

When a rating is created or updated, the system automatically updates the user's employment statistics:

```json
{
  "employmentStats": {
    "averageRating": 4.3,
    "totalReviews": 25,
    "ratingBreakdown": {
      "punctuality": 4.5,
      "quality": 4.2,
      "professionalism": 4.4,
      "communication": 4.1,
      "reliability": 4.3
    },
    "recommendationRate": 88
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexing** - Ratings are indexed by user, employer, and gig completion for fast queries
- **Aggregation** - Rating statistics are calculated using MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- **Caching** - Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed rating statistics
- **Pagination** - All list endpoints support pagination to handle large datasets

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required** - All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access** - Rating creation/updates restricted to employers
- **Owner Verification** - Users can only modify their own ratings
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation on all inputs
- **Soft Deletes** - Ratings are never permanently deleted for audit purposes
